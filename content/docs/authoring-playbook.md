How to author a section in the Hugo build: pure Markdown + shortcodes. The
mechanical rules are enforced by the tooling (`npm test`, `npm run
verify-section`) — author, run the verifier, fix what it reports. You should not
have to memorize the mechanical rules; the lints know them.

This playbook describes the repository's current Hugo architecture. Content is
plain Markdown with Hugo shortcodes; React, JSX, MDX, and Nextra metadata are
not valid authoring syntax.

## 0. Source-first workflow (required for AI agents)

Automated checks can prove that syntax renders and an authored answer grades
against itself. They cannot prove that the transcription is faithful or that
the answer is mathematically correct.

Before writing:

1. Read `AGENTS.md`, this playbook, and—when applicable—the Knowledge Check
   playbook. Inspect `git status` and preserve unrelated work.
2. Use the local source PDF as the content authority. Render and visually read
   the relevant section pages and Answer Key pages. Extracted text or the web
   edition may help locate prose, but neither is authoritative for formulas,
   diagrams, part labels, or answer context.
3. Keep a source ledger in working notes: PDF page range, source section,
   every retained exercise number, its official answer location, and the
   component used. Record any response-mode adaptation or source discrepancy.
4. Preserve the source's objectives, exposition, definitions, procedures,
   examples, and mathematics. Omit only material explicitly allowed by the
   request/playbook. Never silently invent, condense, or “repair” source
   content; flag a suspected source error and show the evidence.
5. For chapter-sized work, divide by section. Each worker must read the same
   playbook, inspect its own PDF pages, run its section verifier, and return its
   source ledger. The parent reconciles every section and runs the book-wide
   gates.

Existing sections authored before July 22, 2026 whose attribution footer
explicitly discloses light condensation are grandfathered. Do not rewrite them
solely to remove that disclosed condensation. New sections and substantive
revisions follow the source-fidelity rule above; never use the grandfathering
exception to justify new omissions.

## 1. Where the file goes

```
content/<subject>/<book>/<NN>-<chapter-slug>/<NN>-<section-slug>.md
```

- Section landings (book cover, chapter overview) are `_index.md`, not
  `index.md`.
- Ordering is by frontmatter **`weight`**.
  Give each section the weight matching its `NN` prefix. At book level,
  chapters and Knowledge Checks share one sequential weight order: insert a
  Knowledge Check immediately after its ending chapter, then continue with the
  next unused weight. A chapter's weight therefore may differ from its chapter
  number after an earlier Knowledge Check.
- Sidebar label defaults to the frontmatter `title`. Set `linkTitle:` only if
  the sidebar label should differ.
- Numeric prefixes are zero-padded, start at `01`, sequential, no gaps. The
  validator enforces this.

Frontmatter for a numbered section:

```yaml
---
title: Add and Subtract Fractions with Common Denominators
description: >-
  One to two sentences summarizing the section.
source_section: "4.4"   # the section number in the SOURCE textbook
weight: 4
---
```

Book root `_index.md` also needs `license:` and `source:` (and carries
`cascade: {type: docs}` so the whole book gets the docs sidebar). Chapter
`_index.md` needs `source_chapter:`. Knowledge-check pages need
`source_chapters:` (e.g. `"1-6"`). `npm run validate` checks all of this.

Every chapter `_index.md` contains a reader-facing overview in this exact
shape:

```md
## Sections

- **Section title** — concise description derived from the section objectives.
```

List every authored section once. Do not copy visible print prefixes such as
`10.1`, and do not fall back to a bare linked outline or title-only bullets.
The content lint enforces the descriptive bullet shape.

## 2. Writing patterns

- **Math:** KaTeX — `$...$` inline, `$$...$$` display (multi-line `$$` fenced on
  their own lines). Group digits with `{,}`: `$37{,}519{,}248$`. Plain prose
  numbers need no `$`. A literal dollar sign (money) is `\$`.
- **Fractions: `\tfrac` everywhere** — inline, in **Check:** sentences, and
  inside `$$` arrays. `\dfrac` is banned and plain `\frac` inside an array
  renders too tall; the lint enforces both. Nested fractions use `\cfrac` in a
  display block.
- **Worked-example step tables:** align relations with `\begin{array}{lrcl}`,
  rows `explanation & LHS &=& RHS \\[4pt]`. Separate steps with `\\[4pt]` (the
  lint rejects bare `\\` in `{lrcl}` arrays).
- **Prose inside math needs TeX spacing:** ordinary spaces outside
  `\text{...}` disappear. Write `\text{If }n^2=m` or
  `\text{If}\ n^2=m`, and use `\ ` between adjacent text commands. Never rely
  on source whitespace in `\text{If} n`, `m \text{is}`, or
  `\text{square}\text{root}`. The lint catches high-confidence joins; the
  rendered page is the final check.
- Unlike MDX, a literal `{` in prose is harmless in Hugo — only `{{` starts a
  shortcode. So set notation like `{3, 6, 9}` is fine in prose (though math sets
  still read best as `$\{3,6,9\}$`).

## 3. Exercises and components (shortcodes)

**Fill-in (free-response math, graded in the browser):**

```
{{</* fillin
  question="Find the sum: $\tfrac{3}{6} + \tfrac{2}{6}$"
  answer="\frac{5}{6}"
  answerDisplay="$\tfrac{5}{6}$"
  hint="Add the numerators and keep the same denominator."
*/>}}
```

LaTeX in `answer` uses a **single** backslash (Hugo passes shortcode params
verbatim — no MDX doubling). `question`/`hint`/`answerDisplay` support inline
`$...$`. The verifier runs every `answer` through the real grader: it must
self-grade `correct`.

Every regular-section exercise needs a concise, strategy-oriented `hint`.
Knowledge Checks deliberately omit hints.

When a prompt asks for an unordered collection of roots or solutions, add
`answerMode="unordered"`:

```
{{</* fillin
  question="Solve $x^2=9$. Enter both solutions, separated by a comma."
  answer="-3,3"
  answerMode="unordered"
  answerDisplay="$x=-3$ or $x=3$"
  hint="Use the Square Root Property and include both signs."
*/>}}
```

Use this mode only when order has no mathematical meaning. Ordered pairs,
ordered triples, coordinate lists, sequences, and prompts that explicitly ask
for larger-first/smaller-first order must keep the default ordered grading.

Every retained source “Try It” or check must become a real `fillin`,
`multiplechoice`, or `graphplot` component. Never ship a static prompt followed
by `<details><summary>Check answer</summary>` or plain answer prose. Choose the
component that matches the learner's response; if the source interaction cannot
be represented faithfully, choose another source item or record the smallest
response-mode adaptation in the source ledger.

Learner-facing fields contain the exercise itself, not print UI:

- Remove prefixes such as `Try It 10.17.` from `question`, `hint`, and
  `answerDisplay`; retain the source number in the ledger.
- A standalone prompt does not keep a source part marker: write
  `Simplify $x^2$`, not `Simplify: (a) $x^2$`.
- Split a genuine multipart task into separate components unless one combined
  response is pedagogically necessary and supported by the grader.

Keep each consecutive interactive practice set to **2–3 questions maximum**,
counting fill-ins, multiple-choice questions, and graphing questions together.
Choose prompts that cover the example's distinct skills instead of repeating
near-identical arithmetic. Dedicated `knowledge-check-XX-YY.md` pages are exempt
because they are cumulative assessments.

**Multiple choice (text mode)** — options are one per line in the body; `answer`
must match an option string exactly:

```
{{</* multiplechoice
  question="Which symbol goes at the endpoint of $x > 2$?"
  answer="parenthesis"
  hint="Is $2 > 2$ true?"
*/>}}
parenthesis
bracket
{{</* /multiplechoice */>}}
```

**Multiple choice (graph mode)** — "which graph is correct?". Options are
prerendered `<svg>` blocks separated by a line `===OPT===`, with
`answerIndex` (0-based). Generate each option SVG with the figure helper
(below). Every option needs an `aria-label`.

**Graph it yourself (GraphPlot):** config (answer + grid) is JSON in the body.

```
{{</* graphplot
  question="Graph the line $y = -4x$ by placing two points on it."
  answerDisplay="$y = -4x$"
  ariaLabel="A blank grid from −7 to 7 on both axes."
  hint="The line passes through the origin."
*/>}}
{"answer": {"slope": -4, "intercept": 0}, "grid": {"xMin": -7, "xMax": 7, "yMin": -7, "yMax": 7}}
{{</* /graphplot */>}}
```

`answer` shapes: `{slope,intercept}`, `{x}`, `{y}`, `{system:[…]}`,
`{quadratic:{a,b,c}}`.

GraphPlot configuration is validated during `npm test`: grid bounds and steps
must be finite, minimums must be below maximums, snap/grid/tick steps must be
positive, and the answer shape must match one of the supported forms.

**Callouts / cards** (Hextra shortcodes):

```
{{</* callout type="info" */>}}
**Note.** Body markdown, including $math$.
{{</* /callout */>}}
```

**Static figures (Graph / NumberLine / Figure):** these are prerendered SVG.
Hugo can't run the geometry at build time, so generate the SVG with the helper
and paste the `<div class="ap-figure">…</div>` block it prints:

```
node tools/render-figure.mjs graph '{"ariaLabel":"The line y = 2x + 1.","lines":[{"slope":2,"intercept":1,"label":"y = 2x + 1"}]}'
```

The accepted JSON properties map to the `buildGraph`, `buildNumberLine`, and
`buildFigure` helpers in `assets/js/lib/graph-core.mjs`. Every figure MUST
carry an `ariaLabel`.

Do not paste or download textbook equation images into content. Write equations
as KaTeX, recreate tabular relationships as Markdown tables, and use the figure
helper for diagrams and graphs so its accessible SVG is embedded directly in
the page. File-backed Markdown/HTML images, raster formats (`.png`, `.jpg`,
`.webp`, and similar), and inaccessible inline SVGs are rejected by the
content lint.

Recreated graphs and diagrams still require visual comparison with the PDF.
Check geometry, labels, axes, endpoints, direction, and dark-mode contrast; a
valid accessible SVG can still be mathematically wrong.

## 4. Verify (the workflow)

From the repository root:

1. Reconcile the finished page against the source ledger and PDF images:
   objectives, examples, math, figures, retained exercises, and official
   answers must all match.
2. Independently solve every touched interactive question and compare both the
   prompt and answer with the source Answer Key. Do not infer correctness from
   self-grading.
3. `npm run verify-section -- content/<subject>/<book>/<ch>/<sec>.md`
   — lints, renders every math run, and confirms that each fill-in answer is
   parseable by the real grader. Fix every ✗ and investigate warnings.
4. Run `npm test`. It includes whole-repository structure validation,
   per-page real-grader verification, unit tests, repo-wide authoring lints,
   documentation consistency checks, and KaTeX parsing. `npm run validate`
   remains available as a focused structure-only command.
5. For chapter/bulk work, run `npm run build` and `npm run check:build` (or
   `npm run ci`). The production audit checks, among other things, that math
   pages load the pinned KaTeX CSS and that its hidden accessibility layer
   cannot appear as duplicate visible math.
6. Open every changed page with `npm run serve`. Confirm real components
   render and grade, prose/math spacing is visible, formulas appear once, and
   figures match the PDF. Also open a changed chapter landing page.
7. Run `git diff --check` and report the changed/untracked files plus the
   source ledger and pages visually checked. Do not commit unless asked.
