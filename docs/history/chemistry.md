# Chemistry 2e — history

Dated narrative for `docs/subjects/chemistry.md`, which keeps only what is
operative. One section per run.

## Chapter 1 pilot (November 9, 2026)

The book's first chapter, *Essential Ideas*, and the first run of any book
on the physical-sciences shelf: six sections (m68664, m68667, m68670,
m68674, m68690, m68683) and the landing page (m68663), authored in two
sessions on one day — the first stopped at the usage limit after the blind
solve, the second ran the extra readings and the close-out. Derek asked
for Opus authors and for one extra check outside the normal process, to
learn from; the extra check became two readings and a third round of
fixes, and most of what the kit now says came from them.

### Shape

- **Wave 1** was two sections (1.3 and 1.6), so the brief, the gates, and
  the grader met real pages before four more authors copied them; **wave
  2** was 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.5. One Opus author and one Opus checker per
  section, checker defects back to the author.
- One Opus **claim pass** for the chapter, then the **blind solve** in a
  fresh Fable agent with masked pages.
- **Extra reading B — the rendered page beside print.** Five Opus readers
  compared 94 viewport tiles of the built pages with the PDF pages.
- **Extra reading C — the six pages against each other.** One Opus reader
  read every page, the playbook, and the run facts together.
- **Round 3.** The parent ruled on both reports (seventeen general
  rulings and a list per page); six Opus fixers applied them, since a new
  session cannot resume the first session's authors; one Opus checker read
  the fixers' edits; a fresh Fable solver re-solved the 56 items whose
  packets had changed and the other 119 carried their first solve.

### What the chapter holds

99 source exercises, 50 of them keyed and carried as one item per lettered
part; the 49 unkeyed are omitted and each footer says how many. 12 Check
Your Learning items. 175 auto-graded items (109 `fillin`, 44
`multiplechoice`, 22 `textin`) and 24 `selfcheck`s; 36 vendored figures.
The practice floor of the `default` profile held on every page.

### What each reading found

| Reading | Found | Could a source reading have found it? |
|---|---|---|
| Authors (their own arithmetic) | the soccer ball's 68 cm for 68.58 (erratum 2878) | yes — it is why authors compute before reading the key |
| Checkers | fillers answered by elimination; hints that decided their items on five of six pages; the text grader reading `/`, `·`, `°` as spaces, so a product passed for a quotient and "°K" for "K"; footer miscounts | yes |
| Claim pass | 19 findings, 8 corrected on the pages: the spider-web "150 million dimes" (π times too many), "chromium does not oxidize", the kilogram "defined by IUPAC", a 6.72 g quarter, an "official January 2014 census", 3.78 L for 3.785, "273.15 … is not exact", the NIST credit | yes |
| Blind solve | 169 of 175 agreed; five stems that did not say what to type (a place, "no prefix added"); on the re-solve, the freezer's −10 °F with no figure count (erratum 2912) | yes |
| Rendered page (B) | display rows cut off at the column edge on 1.5 and 1.6; `1.497 ×` / `10⁻³` broken across lines; the source's half-width drawings filling the column; a Source note that gave its item's key away from beside the empty answer box; an added multiple choice whose stem named two of its three options; a hint that sent the learner to a table without the answer; a four-figure key before the book teaches significant figures | the first three: no. The rest: yes, and nobody had |
| Consistency (C) | the playbook stating the `last-digit` rule twice, differently; 1.5 still carrying, word for word, the hints the hint rule was written from; 177.66 °F against 1.5's own rules and the sibling keys (erratum 2910); "with its sign" on the negative keys only; footers printing added items' keys; a Key equation with a unit standing in for a quantity (2911); 273.2 added after the page had called 273.15 exact; three forms for one stem pattern on three pages | no — each page was legal alone |
| Round-3 checker | three footers that still let a key be worked out; two rewritten hints that pointed at nothing on the page; a hint pasted on an item it did not fit | — |

The rendered-page reading seeded tests and is not a standing pass; the
consistency reading found the most per token and is (`run.md`).

### Rulings the run overturned

- **177.66 °F.** The solver flagged it; the first parent kept the source
  key and added "to the hundredths place" to the stem ("physically
  defensible"); the consistency reader set it against Section 1.5's rules
  and against the module's other temperature keys, all of which round by
  those rules, and the key became 177.7 with a Source note. Lesson, now in
  the playbook: check the siblings — one outlier is a defect, a module
  that rounds one way throughout is a convention.
- **`\dfrac` for inline fractions** and **digits grouped as the source
  prints them, in math too** — two round-3 rulings that existing lint
  errors refuse (`\dfrac` is banned; a four-digit number in math is
  grouped). Both were withdrawn after a fixer hit the lint. Lesson, now in
  `run.md`: a ruling is linted before it is sent.
- **Cross-references as links.** The run facts promised the parent would
  link sibling sections after the wave; no book in the library links
  between its sections, and they stay plain text.
- **"This lumber can be used as vertical studs…"** was reworded under the
  restate-given-data rule, and the coverage gate stopped matching the part
  to its source. A referent with no datum keeps the source's words.

### Engine, gates, lints, tests

- **Grader.** `whole-number` (a count refuses the stem's own "2.0"
  retyped); a bare power-of-ten key is an exact factor, in any writing; a
  bare `10^{n}` reads as one figure; too-few-figures feedback only one
  figure short; MathLive's `\operatorname{\mathrm{kg}}`, `\min`, and "in."
  read as units.
- **Gates.** `tools/lib/keyed-units.mjs` (one keyed unit per lettered
  part, shared by the keys and coverage gates); `verify:source-coverage`
  reads `content/physical-sciences`, counts an unkeyed exercise as
  `omitted`, and fails one that is rendered; `verify:source-keys` reads
  the `exercises` class, Check Your Learning notes (`<example id>#check`),
  the "Answers will vary" form, and the most specific named option;
  `verify:ledger` requires a solve and provenance for the shelf;
  `verify:replay`'s allowlist test walks the whole corpus (its first
  Chemistry entry is the total mass that IS the printed reactant mass).
- **Lints (Chemistry).** A `textin` key carrying `/`, `·`, `×`, `*`, or
  `°`; a `textin` keyed to a word of its own objective heading; "with its
  sign"; an inline equation run into the next sentence; a footer that
  prints "(blank: …)"; a Key term without its closing period. The
  consecutive-question cap counts items sharing one lead-in as one.
- **Rendering.** A short inline number in scientific notation is held on
  one line, by the passthrough render hook and by the `mathtext` partial
  that renders shortcode strings (the first version of the browser test
  passed with the partial unwrapped, on table cells alone — a floor on
  the count in fill-in stems now holds it). `source:media` records the
  source's `scaled-down` class and the figure keeps that share of the
  column.
- **Browser tests.** Every measured key on 1.6 typed key by key; a
  two-digit exponent of either sign; a typed unit; the exact prefix
  factor; and, on every Chemistry section page the build has, no display
  row wider than the column, no scientific notation split across lines, no
  scaled-down figure at full width.
- **Tools.** `tools/source/chemistry-prep.py` (the pilot's two scratch
  extractors, promoted) and `tools/build/screenshot-tiles.mjs`.

### What the process got wrong, and what was done

- **The extra readings ran after the solve**, so round 3 re-hashed 131 of
  175 items. `run.md` puts every reading and every ruling before the
  solve.
- **No ledger snapshot before round 3**, so nothing could be carried by
  the tool; a remap script carried the 119 items whose solver packet was
  identical and the rest were re-solved. `run.md` §0 now says to snapshot.
- **The fixers' brief said a hint-only edit keeps an item's hash.** It
  does not. One fixer filed 9 results for 46 re-hashed items.
- **`ledger:provenance` calls an item with no author note "author-built
  from § …"**, which is right for a life-sciences recall item and wrong
  for a source exercise. The pilot carried the authors' own notes to the
  new hashes by question text instead. Open: teach the tool the book, or
  keep snapshotting so it is never needed.
- **The claim-pass reader saw the parent's list of suspected claims** — a
  grep of the scratchpad for a phrase hit `PARENT-NOTES.md`. It said so,
  and its agreement on four of five leads is not blind. The parent's notes
  now live in `$SP/parent-only/`, and every reader's brief forbids the
  directory by name.
- **The errata Clerk's block was read back by script**: every quoted
  fragment of a "Current text" bullet checked against the CNXML, every
  quoted fragment of "Local handling" against the page. Nine misses, all
  markup (a link or math inside the quotation).

### Not acted on

- Inline fractions set at about 11 px (three rendered-page findings):
  house style, as the math books' `\tfrac`.
- A number and its unit parting at a line end: the library writes no
  no-break spaces.
- The compact navbar covering the right end of the article's top line
  between 1100 and 1280 px, the 50 px above "Show hint", the footer's
  leading: site-wide, left for a design decision.
- The grader's "give it to 4 significant figures" on a page that comes
  before Section 1.5: the stems there state the place in plain words.
- The symbol of a prefix typed in the wrong case (`M` for `m`) is graded
  as the text grader grades everything, without case.

### Numbers

Errata 2878–2913 (36 entries, twelve with a `reconciliation-decisions.json`
entry, two with a `DISCLOSED_DEVIATIONS` line; 2913 is a Link to Learning
redirect that fails its TLS handshake, kept linked and disclosed). Baselines: keys confirmed
6,725 → 6,916; source exercises covered 3,962 → 4,117; ledger exercises
17,296 → 17,495; replayed spans 8,122 → 8,224. Extra readings: five
rendered-page readers at 150–170k tokens each, the consistency reader at
about 210k, six fixers at 75–160k, the fix checker at about 165k, the
re-solve at about 150k.
